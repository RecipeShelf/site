##### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. 

A valid payment method, including Credit Card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Recipe Shelf with accurate and complete billing information and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Recipe Shelf to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. 

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Recipe Shelf cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page for a Credit Card Subscription or through PayPal for a PayPal Subscription. 

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Recipe Shelf will issue a notice indicating that you must update your credit card, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. For PayPal subscriptions, PayPal will manage failed payments and you should contact PayPal to resolve the issue.
