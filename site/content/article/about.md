Hello! I am Sirisha, one of the founders of Recipe Shelf. I love to cook and I am always on the lookout for new recipes and ideas. Through the years, I have found that searching for recipes on the Internet can be a nightmare. There are thousands of blogs and cooking websites, and it took me an enormous amount of research to identify a genuinely good blog or website. And I had do it all over again for a different recipe!

With finding a recipe, there is the additional hassle of making a shopping list. Instead of buying whatever was in season, I ended up making repeated trips to the supermarket for each new recipe. Meanwhile, the ingredients that I already had in my refrigerator would go to waste. I vented to my brother Prasad, who is an awesome software developer. He came up with the concept of Recipe Shelf and here we are!
